# CROWD-SOURCING PLATFORM FOR NATIONAL VIRTUAL LIBRARY OF INDIA

National virtual library of India (NVLI) is a platform for storing digital assets of India. The digital assets uploaded to this library have to be made searchable. For this purpose appropriate metadata tags need to be associated with every digital asset. The best person to tag the assets is the creator. However most of the creators leave them untagged making it inappropriate for search engines. The crowd-sourcing platform will distribute the tagging among many users thus facilitating the search engines.

## Description

Digital Assets to be made searchable need to be tagged when stored in the repository. However, it is not possible for one person to tag all the digital assets as it is a very tedious task. To ease this process the work can be crowd-sourced using this platform. Authorized users can add tasks to be tagged. Images, Audio files, Video files and documents can be uploaded for tagging. Task Redundancy can be set which indicates the minimum number of times each entity needs to be tagged. Once an asset is tagged for the required number of times, the tags are saved and the image is not available for further tagging. Tags can be later reviewed to ensure minimum error in the tags given by users.
