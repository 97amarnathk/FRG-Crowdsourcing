================
Changelog v2.3.8
================

If you are going to upgrade to this version you will have to be sure
to run the following steps:

 * Take a backup of your database. 
 * Get the latest code.
 * Install all the dependencies.
 * Run alembic upgrade head. This will run a migration in the DB.
 * Run the command python cli.py update_counters. This command will take some time. It will populate your new table counters with the current status of the DB. RUN this step otherwise the system will fail.
   

If you are installing this version for the very first time, just go with the standard setup.
