    Please, backup the database before continuing.

In order to upgrade you will have to pull the new code, and then run the
following command to upgrade the database::

  source env/bin/activate

Then restart your server, and you will be done.

NOTE: depending on your server, the creation of results will vary based on number of
completed tasks and task_runs.
