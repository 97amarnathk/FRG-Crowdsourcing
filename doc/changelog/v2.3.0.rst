================
Changelog v2.3.0
================


This new version adds a few cool features to PYBOSSA. Basically, it allows to use
PYBOSSA backend as your crowdsourcing engine for native iOS and Android phone apps.

The idea is that those apps, usually have their own user base, with their own IDs.

As a result, you don't want to force your user base to register again in another 
service just to help you with your crowdsourcing research. Therefore, PYBOSSA comes
to the rescue allowing you to login those users in a PYBOSSA project using a secure
token (JWT).

The process is really simple, you create a PYBOSSA project, you copy the secret key
created by PYBOSSA for your project and you use it to authenticate your requests. Then
when a user sends a Task Run you pass your authentication token and your internal user
ID. As simple as that. PYBOSSA will handle everything as usual.

 * Add support for external User IDs. 
 * Add JWT authentication for projects.
