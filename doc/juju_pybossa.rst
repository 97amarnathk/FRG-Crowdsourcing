Installing PYBOSSA with Juju
============================

With this guide you can deploy PYBOSSA using the Juju_ technology inside a Virtualbox
Virtual Machine (VM) locally. We will use Vagrant_  as it will help us to setup the 
new VM. This should work on all supported OSes where Vagrant and Virtualbox run: 
Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux.

.. _Juju: https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/getting-started
.. _Vagrant: https://www.vagrantup.com/


.. note::

    We use the local installation, but you can use any cloud provider supported by
    Juju_. If you want to use a cloud provider, you only have to instruct Juju to use
    a specific cloud one. The charm will work in any of them without problems.
    Please check the official documentation for information about how to
    configure Juju_ for `Amazon EC2`_ or `Openstack`_.


Install Virtualbox & Vagrant
============================

We will install PYBOSSA in a local virtual machine so you can delete it afterwards
if you want. This will ensure that your computer is not polluted with libraries that
you will not need any future, containing everything within the virtual machine.

.. note::
    If you have access to a cloud service provider like `Amazon EC2`_ or any 
    Openstack_
    solution, you can just skip this section. Be sure to configure juju with your cloud
    credentials. You can find more guides and cloud provider configurations here_.

.. _`Amazon EC2`: https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/config-aws
.. _Openstack: https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/config-openstack
.. _here: https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/getting-started

Install Vagrant and Virtualbox if they are not available on your
machine.

Ubuntu
~~~~~~

Just install it using the package manager

::

    sudo apt-get update 
    sudo apt-get -y install virtualbox vagrant

Windows & OS X
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install and download `Virtualbox <https://www.virtualbox.org>`__ and
`Vagrant <http://www.vagrantup.com>`__ manually.

Get latest version of PYBOSSA Juju charm
========================================

You have two options to get the latest version of PYBOSSA Juju charm. 
You get a ZIP file with the latest version from this link:
https://github.com/Scifabric/pybossa-jujucharm/archive/master.zip

Or you use git to clone it:

::

    git clone https://github.com/Scifabric/pybossa-jujucharm.git

.. note::
    If you use the ZIP file, please unzip it before proceeding.


Go the source code folder

::

    cd pybossa-jujucharm


Start the VM
============

This is very easy:

::

    vagrant up


Setup Juju
==========

SSH to the Vagrant box and **stay** in the VM

::

    vagrant ssh

Prepare Juju for initial usage:

::

    juju init
    juju switch local
    juju bootstrap


PYBOSSA bundle
==============

Install the Pybossa charm bundle which will install PYBOSSA charm and PostgreSQL charm and connect them to eachother.

::

    juju deployer -c bundle.yaml


Once is installed, we can install PYBOSSA and connect both of them.

Sentinel and Redis
==================

You can also install Redis and Sentinel at a later stage using Juju. This will allow
you to add new Redis slave nodes as well as Sentinels to manage the Redis infrastructure
using the load-balanced solution of Sentinel.

Adding Redis Master and Slave nodes
===================================

First you need to deploy at least two nodes of Redis: a master and a slave:

::

    juju deploy cs:~juju-gui/trusty/redis-1
    juju deploy cs:~juju-gui/trusty/redis-1 redis2

Then, you need link them:

::

    juju add-relation redis:master redis2:slave

Adding Sentinel node
====================

Now you can add the Sentinel

:: 

    juju git-deploy Scifabric/redis-sentinel-jujucharm

.. note::
   If you don't have the git-deploy command for juju, you can install it with these commands:
   :: 

    sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    sudo pip install juju-git-deploy

And monitor Redis master

::

    juju add-relation redis-sentinel redis:master

Finally, you can link PYBOSSA to sentinel

::

    juju add-relation pybossa redis-sentinel

.. note::
    For more info regarding the Juju charm for Sentinel, please
    check the official site_.


.. _site: https://github.com/Scifabric/redis-sentinel-jujucharm/

Access PYBOSSA
==============

Look for the machine IP of PYBOSSA service here:

::

    juju status

Copy & Paste the IP and pass it to the following script 

::

    sudo natpybossa 10.0.3.x


Which will map the PYBOSSA server port to your localhost's port 7000.

You can now view PYBOSSA in your browser:

::

    http://localhost:7000


Email server
============

PYBOSSA does not need an email server by default, but we encourage you to install one.

Sending email properly is a bit complicated, as nowadays you have configure several authentication methods
so your emails are not marked as SPAM or black listed. This configuration involves not only modifying the 
config file of your email server, but also the DNS entries of your server so you can include the proper
DKIM_ and SPF_ entries. Therefore, the Juju charm only installs a testing server. 

Please, use the official documentation of your preferred server to configure the email properly.

.. _DKIM: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_authentication#Authentication_methods
.. _SPF: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_authentication#Authentication_methods

sshuttle whole network mapping (optional)
=========================================

This is an alternative way for mapping internal ports to the VM ones. Instead of 
using the shell scripts that you have seen before for NAT configuration, you can use 
**sshuttle**. In Ubuntu you can install it with apt-get or in OS X with Homebrew.

The Virtualbox network is only internally visible on the VM side. If you
want to see it on your local browser you need to redirect the VBox
network with your current network (make sure the 10.x.x.x is not already used!).

The VBox is typically on 10.0.3.xxx. Open a new console on your local
machine and type:

::

    sshuttle -r vagrant@localhost:2222 10.0.3.0/24

``sshuttle`` maybe asks for local sudo password. If it asks for vagrant's password: ``vagrant``

Finally open your browser with the IP you got from ``juju status`` and
HAProxy, e.g.:

::

    http://10.0.3.89

Juju GUI (optional)
===================

If you prefer a graphical interface, you are covered. Juju provides a very nice web
interface from where you can handle PYBOSSA services. To use it, follow these steps:

::

    juju deploy juju-gui

When juju-gui is deployed (can take some time), the command will return a public IP. 
You can check the IP also with this command as well as the status of the deployment
of the GUI:

::

    juju status

Then, copy & paste the IP and pass it as an argument to the following script 

::

    sudo natgui 10.0.3.x

This file will map the Juju-GUI to your localhost's port 8000, and return the password
for your Juju-GUI. Copy the password, and open the Juju-GUI in your browser

:: 

    https://localhost:8000

If you've used Sentinel, Redis, PostgreSQL, HAProxy and PYBOSSA, your GUI should show something similar to this:
