Contributing to the PYBOSSA development
=======================================
Thus you have decided that this project is interesting and you want to help us: **THANKS!**

If you want to help us you can do it by:

 * Proposing new features in the `Issues page <https://github.com/Scifabric/pybossa/issues>`_,
 * Submitting new bugs/issues in the `Issues page <https://github.com/Scifabric/pybossa/issues>`_, or
 * Fixing bugs and sending us actual code patches.

The project is using the popular `Github Workflow 
<http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html>`_. 
The basic ideas of this work flow are the following:

 * The master branch is always deployable, so never ever code there!
 * Create a branch with a meaningful name and work on it as much as you want.
 * When you are ready, issue a git pull request and we will merge it.

Please, read carefully the Github workflow and let us know if need help collaborating with us.
If you like the framework and you want to contribute, this section explain how
